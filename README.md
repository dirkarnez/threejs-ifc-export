### TODOs
- [ ] obj generation -> geometry extraction
- [ ] **https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/blob/v0.7.0/src/blenderbim/scripts/obj2ifc.py**
- [ ] Simplify ifc input (primitive shape fitting / primitive decomposition)
 - > 3D Reconstruction Software: Some 3D reconstruction software packages, like MeshLab or CloudCompare, offer features for primitive shape fitting. These tools often provide automated algorithms or interactive tools to decompose complex objects into simpler shapes.
